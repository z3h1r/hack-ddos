# Modern hack of service kit

tool is a hacktool checking plugin for Vim created by z3h1r. It runs files through external tool checkers and displays any resulting errors to the user. This can be done on demand, or automatically as files are saved. If syntax errors are detected, the user is notified and is happy because they didn't have to compile their code or execute their script to find them.
